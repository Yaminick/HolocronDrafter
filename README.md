A hacked-together way to draft custom Magic: the Gathering sets online.

## Features
* Draft custom Magic sets online with your friends!
* Graphical deck builder allows you to build your deck as you draft!
* That's it. [Screenshot.](http://i.imgur.com/ssYb7TB.jpg)

## Requirements
Windows and .NET 4.0, until someone wants to do a Mono port.

## What's Broken?
Well, a lot of stuff. For starters:
* Slow image downloading
* Little to no error handling when parsing set files, loading images, etc.
* Graphical glitches galore

## Coming Eventually
* More error handling
* Better image downloading

## How to Use
* Install the included Magic Set Editor script. (Put the magic-isochrondrafter.mse-export-template folder into the data folder of your MSE install.)
* Export your set from Magic Set Editor using the script. (File->Export->HTML...->Isochron Drafter Exporter)
* Export card images from your set -- filename must be "cardname.full.jpg", and contain no commas or apostrophes, which Magic Set Editor removes by default.
* Upload the card images from your set somewhere.
* In Isochron Drafter, start a server. Browse to the exported set file and enter the remote image directory.
* If you're behind a router, [make sure](http://www.canyouseeme.org/) port 10024 is [forwarded to your computer](http://www.wikihow.com/Set-Up-Port-Forwarding-on-a-Router).
* Have everyone connect to the IP you're hosting the server on.
* Start the draft on the server.
* Enjoy.
